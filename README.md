# PowerBIClimateProject
Project I made in college visualising climate data.

We were given 3 excel data sheets which related to climate change, and were to demonstrate how data visualisation can improve a companyâ€™s news articles using a data visualisation tool of our choice. The aim was to prepare and clean the data, to tell a story using visualisations.
